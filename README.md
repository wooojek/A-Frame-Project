# A-Frame_Project
Project to play with a-frame

GitHub Pages: https://wooojek.github.io/A-Frame-Project/

## Why?
To have my own place to play with A-frame which I got interested in :)

### What now?
Now I'm playing with events and handling them, got few ideas, but for now I have to figure out how to make Equirectangular Image from screenshots.
